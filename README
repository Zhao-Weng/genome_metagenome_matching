Usage:

You need to first create two folders.
put clean.sh and process.sh in strains2_training_genomes folder after download 
put all the genomes (fna) file into strains2_training_genomes folder
put all the metagenomes (fastq) file into strains2_training_metagenomes folder

./process.sh to run the shell script
./clean.sh if you want to redo the process
python gidx.py to generate the features. Note that you have to download all the genomes and put them in the "strains_training_genomes" folder and put all the metagenomes in the "strains_training_metagenomes" folder. You also need to download the truthtable. All these files and folders should be at the same directory asthe gidx.py file

change certain line if necessary (if you only want to run certain column of data)

parse.py and parse_meta.py to parse the genomes into a long string and parse metagenomes into a list of strings

gidx.py to generate the features in csv format.

process.sh script will assume strains2_training_genomes and strains2_training_metagenomes lie in the same folder.
