Usage:

You need to first create two folders.
put clean.sh and process.sh in strains2_training_genomes folder after download 
put all the genomes (fna) file into strains2_training_genomes folder
put all the metagenomes (fastq) file into strains2_training_metagenomes folder

./process.sh to run the shell script
./clean.sh if you want to redo the process

change certain line if necessary (if you only want to run certain column of data)

parse.py and parse_meta.py to parse the genomes into a long string and parse metagenomes into a list of strings

gidx.py to generate the features in csv format.

process.sh script will assume strains2_training_genomes and strains2_training_metagenomes lie in the same folder.
